Welcome to Nyle's Dojo. Take your shoes off.

### What's a Kata?

Kata is a Japanese word meaning "form". It is a pattern of martial arts movements that are designed to be repeated and practiced.

The primary intention of these katas is to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) and learn new methods of pairing.
